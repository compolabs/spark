# Account Value and Free Collateral

### Account Value

Account value is essential for calculating margin ratio and free collateral.

This value is the sum of your collateral, any unrealized PnL (profit & loss) and any settled or pending fees and funding payments associated with your open positions:

### Free Collateral

Free collateral is funds you have available for using as margin, i.e., opening positions. It is also used in determining how much you can withdraw from the exchange at any given time.
